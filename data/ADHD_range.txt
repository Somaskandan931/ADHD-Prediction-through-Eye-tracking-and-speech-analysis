| Feature            | ADHD Typical Range   | Non-ADHD Typical Range | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Jitter (%)         | 0.8 – 1.5            | 0.3 – 0.8              | Jitter is usually higher in ADHD due to unstable voice pitch |
| Shimmer (%)        | 3 – 5                | 1 – 3                  | Shimmer reflects amplitude variation                         |
| Pause Count        | 5 – 15 (per passage) | 2 – 6                  | ADHD often has more frequent pauses                          |
| Pause Duration (s) | 0.2 – 1.0            | 0.1 – 0.5              | Longer pauses common in ADHD                                 |
